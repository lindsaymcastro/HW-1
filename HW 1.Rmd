Machine Learning Main Ideas

Question 1:
"[S]upervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs" and "unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output" (from pg. 1 of book)


Question 2:
The difference between a regression model and a classification model is that the regression model has a quantitative response, while a classification model has a qualitative response. 


Question 3:
The two commonly used metrics in regression are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absoulte Error (MAE). 
The two commonly used Performance metrics for classification problems are Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix.


Question 4:
Descriptive models are used typically to choose model to best visually emphasize a trend in data.

Inferential models are aimed to test theories and state the relationship between outcome and predictor(s).

Predictive models are aimed to predict Y with minimum redicuble error, and are not focused on hypothesis tests.
(from Lecture Slides Day 2)


Question 5:
Mechanistic assumes a parametric form for f, and you can usually add parameters, which allows more flexibility.
Empirically-driven means that there are no assumptions made about f, which requires a large number of observations. 
They are similar because both can be overfitting for the data modeled, and both are pretty flexible as well.



the parametric approach will outperform the non- parametric approach if the parametric form that has been selected is close to the true form of f
